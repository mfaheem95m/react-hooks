        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p className="text">
          The useId hook in React generates unique IDs for components, enhancing
          accessibility. It should be called at the top level of a component,
          returning a unique string specific to that instance. It's crucial to
          avoid using it inside loops or conditions, and it should not be used
          for generating keys in lists; instead, keys should derive from the
          data. useId is particularly useful for associating input fields with
          descriptive elements through attributes like aria-describedby.
          Additionally, it ensures consistency between server-rendered and
          client-rendered HTML, preventing ID mismatches that could cause
          hydration issues. Unlike incrementing counters, useId guarantees
          matching IDs across server and client, preventing accessibility
          problems and maintaining stability during hydration. However, it's
          important to ensure IDs remain unique across component instances to
          avoid conflicts.

          The useId hook in React generates unique IDs for components, enhancing
          accessibility. When dealing with multiple related elements, call useId
          once to create a base ID for them (e.g., id + '-firstName'). For
          rendering multiple React apps on the same page, use the
          identifierPrefix option in createRoot or hydrateRoot to prevent ID
          clashes. Additionally, ensure that the same identifierPrefix is used
          for both server rendering and client hydration to maintain ID
          consistency.
